libmultialn depends on the following packages:

 * libcds (available at https://github.com/fclaude/libcds/)
 * Google test for unit tests

Cmake 2.8 is used to build this. To configure the build environment, run

$ cmake -DLIBCDS_ROOT=<path to libcds root> .

Afterwards, running make will build the project.

To enble unit tests, run cmake with -DENABLE_TEST=ON as well. Then, after
rebuilding with make, run test/multialn_test to see the results of the
test suite.
